## About Me

Hi, my name is Johnny and I am a computer science student from Germany. 

Over the last couple of years, computer science has captivated me. I have a particular interest in programming, programming languages and concepts as well as the more theoretical side of things sometimes. But I also love learning about new topics and expanding my horizon.

Topics that I'm currently invested in or eager to learn more about:  Functional Programming, Systems Programming, programming language theory and mathematics. 

I am working a lot with Clojure and the JVM at the moment.

## About this Blog

This is a personal blog where I try to share knowledge, perspectives and insights I have gathered during my process of learning or just things I find interesting. I will write about whatever I feel like writing about - though the primary focus will be technology and programming.
