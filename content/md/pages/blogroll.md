Note: I include some, but not all of these in my post recommendation system (the three suggestions you see under every one of my own posts). For example, I exclude blogs with very frequent posts, such as todepond, pluralistic and Schneier on security. The reason is that my recommendation selection is only updated daily, which means that such blogs easily drown out the rest.

## Give me more blogs to read!

I'm rather new to the world of blogging and just beginning to read blogs regularly, so I'm looking to expand this list. If you have a recommendation, send a link [my way](/pages/about/#contact) and it might join this list. Feel free to recommend your own blog as well!
