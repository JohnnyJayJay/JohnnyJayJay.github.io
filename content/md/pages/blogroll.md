## Give me more blogs to read!

I'm rather new to the world of blogging and just beginning to read blogs regularly, so I'm looking to expand this list. If you have a recommendation, send a link [my way](/pages/about/#contact) and it might join this list. Feel free to recommend your own blog as well!
