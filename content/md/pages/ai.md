{:title "On the use of so-called 'Generative AI'"

<small><i>This page is a work in progress; it will be expanded in the future.</i></small>

This blog is entirely authored by me, a human person. I view writing not as a chore, but as a healthy habit, an exercise for the mind if you will, with the nice side effect of improving my language abilities. The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT is incompatible with this view. Claims that LLMs are the logical next step or an inevitable evolution in the world of writing completely miss the point of the craft.

## Artificial (Lack of) Intelligence

## Non-solutions for Fake Problems

## The Age of Noise

## Ignored Cimate Reality

 <!-- - age of noise (data polluting on the internet - it takes 1 SEO guy with an AI to flush away the work of 100 creatives - heading towards habsburg AIs) -->
 <!-- - pattern matching machines are not intelligent, they match patterns. LLMs are good *imitating* humans, but not actually being intelligent -->
 <!-- - hype around GenAI is the typical "finding problems for a solution" mania that we've seen so many times before - people in tech should stop being the ones in charge of deciding whether something is a good solution for something -->
 <!--   - racial bias paper -->
 <!--   - it's used in areas where no one ever asked for it -->
 <!--   - great way to avoid responsibility and accountability for mistakes -->
 <!-- - climate disaster - massive amounts of energy -->
