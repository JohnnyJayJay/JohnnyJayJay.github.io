{:title "On the use of so-called 'Generative AI'"
 :layout :page}

This blog is entirely authored by me, a human person.

Writing, to me, isn't a chore. It's not a tool to generate traffic or attention. It's a form of expression that *lives* from the writer's mind, emotions and experiences. Using LLMs like ChatGPT that supposedly "write for you" amounts to missing the point of the craft. I have no interest in churning out meaningless posts just to fill a void that I can't or don't want to fill myself. Incompleteness is fine, gaps are fine. The idea that we should stuff everything with "content" slop is dystopian to me.

Conversely, I don't want to *read* text or *look at* pictures that are generated by AI. They're bad art at best and drowning out proper human creation at worst. No matter how impressive it is "for a computer", generative AI does not *create* but *rehash*, by design. I don't care about rehashes of mediocre quality, especially when they're not even close to producing anything reliable.

Instead of making this a longer-form essay, I've decided to use the rest of this page as a collection of links to resources that make a better case for rejecting the ongoing AI hype than I ever could. I will expand this section with more articles, research and opinion pieces as I encounter them.
