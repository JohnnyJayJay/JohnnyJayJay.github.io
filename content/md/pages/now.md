Aren't you just burning to know what I'm up to at the moment? No? Well, here you go anyway.

## Studies 

I'm now in my eigth semester of studying computer science (B.Sc.). This semester, I'm learning more about:

- German private law
- EU digital regulation
- Cybersecurity
- Software sustainability
- Psychology and interface design

The end of my studies is approaching ‚Äì after this semester, I will likely have collected everything I need to graduate (except for the thesis). I'm still debating whether I should aim to write my Bachelor's thesis in this year's winter semester, or wait until next year. If I wait another semester, I could participate in a couple more interesting courses and lectures while I'm here without having any pressure. This would also give me some time to think about what my thesis should even be about.

## Work

I'm still working part-time. Since mid last year, I've been heavily focused on DevOps, in particular Jenkins, Azure, Kubernetes, Argo CD and more recently Upbound/Crossplane. Helping developers set up CI/CD for their projects isn't the most exciting thing in the world as it tends to get rather repetitive, but I've become quite good at it and I would consider myself a seasoned member of our infrastructure team at this point.

While I think that it's not the most exciting, I don't mean that it's particularly boring or alienating. I've built a routine, I'm learning about things I was completely unfamiliar with before and I've been given a lot more responsibility in recent months. Financially, branching out into DevOps has been pretty good, too: convincing customers to pay a part-time working student to do something is apparently a lot easier in DevOps than in regular software development. Maybe it's because nobody really has a clue what the "cloud" is but everybody wants in anyway. 

I do plan to return to development a bit more in the near future, though ‚Äì I want to write some code again. Some variety will do me good, I think. 

## Places

Currently, I'm on vacation on the Greek island of Crete. I'm relaxing, reading and looking at beautiful landscapes.

There's one more vacation for me this year, although there are no final plans yet. I am going to travel around Belgium and the Netherlands along the coast by train for a week or so. The current idea is to visit 4-ish cities during that time, definitely including Amsterdam and Rotterdam/Den Haag (they're close enough to each other to count as one, right?). I would also really love to see Utrecht on the way back, though I'll possibly have to do so without a companion. Unfortunately plans are generally a bit difficult to make because I don't know when my exams for that semester will take place yet. There are no official summer holidays at my university üòê
